## Testing

This template uses Vitest with two test projects:

### Unit Tests (`test:unit`)

Fast tests that run in jsdom. Use for testing:

- Utility functions
- Pure logic
- Hooks (using `renderHook` from `@neovici/testing`)

```typescript
// test/example.test.ts
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest';
import { myFunction } from '../src/utils';

describe('myFunction', () => {
	it('does something', () => {
		expect(myFunction()).toBe(expected);
	});
});
```

### Storybook Tests (`test:storybook`)

Browser-based tests using Playwright. Use for testing:

- Component rendering
- User interactions
- Visual behavior

Tests are written as `play` functions in story files.

### Important: Imports in Story Files

**Never import from `'vitest'` in story files:**

```typescript
import { expect } from 'vitest'; // Crashes deployed Storybook
```

**Use `'storybook/test'` instead:**

```typescript
import { expect } from 'storybook/test'; // Works everywhere
```

Vitest's `expect` requires an active test context and crashes when stories run in the deployed Storybook UI.
